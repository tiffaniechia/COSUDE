                    <p>
                        When we see a cheap clothing shirt, our first response is usually, 'this is so cheap, I need to
                        buy it!'.
                        But if it is so cheap, how little do the people making it actually earn?

                    6/7 days a week, 10 hours a day, earning less than $3USD a day, many have to sell their
                    furniture in order to see the doctor.
                    Fast fashion brands justify it saying this teaches skills. But for factory productivity, workers sew
                    the same seam on the same shirt over and over again.
                    It is hard to learn anything if you're sewing the exact same seam a thousand times.

                    What happens if you need more clothes for cheaper? You build more factories and squeeze the margins
                    from them.
                    Structurally unsafe buildings were made to fulfill these orders quickly. As a result, hundreds upon
                    thousands have died in building fires and collapses.

                    You can demand for a transparent supply chain.
