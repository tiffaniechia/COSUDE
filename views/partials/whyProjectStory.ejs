        <h1>WHY COSUDE?</h1>
        <p>
            Over a thousand factory workers died after being made to go back into a structurally unsafe building in
            order to fulfil a stretched order of fast fashion clothing. Someone could have lost a mother, a daughter, a
            father, or a son, because of a £5 shirt with ‘swag’ written across the chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hundreds of thousands of factory workers in third world countries are paid less than USD$3 a day for hours
            of sewing the same stitch, over 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, for an entire year.
        </p>

            Workers demanding for a decent living wage - to have enough to eat- were being locked inside rooms and
            beaten, for fear of disturbing this low cost supply chain.

            Yet in the two minutes you took to read these three paragraphs, fast fashion companies have sold
            approximately £147,000 worth of clothing, and a garment factory worker (usually female) would have only made
            £0.03. It is estimated that the industry as a whole generates between £500 billion and £2 trillion annually,
            all at the gross expense of the people making these clothes.

            The sad truth about the economy is that companies have less than little incentive to change - they only
            respond to competition and their consumers. Cosude wants to empower the only voices these companies will
            hear, to use technology to empower consumers and conscious makers to rival big companies, and to demand for
            a conscious supply chain. </p>
        <p>
            But before we can tackle such a large issue, we need to find the linchpin, the main problem, in order to move on.
